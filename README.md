# My Bike landing page

- A landing page was created by design, with HTML, SCSS, and a bit of JavaScript.
- The page was constructed using a display grid and SCSS mixins, ensuring proper functionality across various device widths and heights.
- Grid-item modifiers were created using SCSS functions within a 'for' loop.

- Page design: [MYBIKE landing](https://www.figma.com/file/NZQAIydtHo5QkINyGLHNcq/BIKE-New-Version?node-id=0%3A1)
